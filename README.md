# Landing page project

This is my first project, and I hope that it will be successfully done with all the conditions that is required for this project.

I have added sections with javascript.

I have built a navigation menu dynamically with the number of sections added and also added data-nav content of each section to the content of each anchor tag in the navigation menu.

I have added functionality to the li tag in the navigation menu that when section 1 is in the viewport ,section 1 in the navigation menu is highlighted with another color.

I have added functionality to each section tag that when section 1 for example is in the viewport , a class will be added to this section that will add some styling to this section to make it clear which section is being viewed.
